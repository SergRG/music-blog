                    <h2> Gym Life </h2>
                    <p> On my free time i like to spend most of my days off in the gym , i enjoy this because it has
                        tought me to be disipline and patience with the trust on the process. Also when i dont do go i
                        start feeling depressed and lazy probably because i like to stay competitive with myself. </p>

                    <h2> Basketball & Soccer</h2>
                    <p> i started playing soccer since i was in 6th grade in a sunday legue and continued playing until
                        i got out of high school but i still enjoy watching it.one of the main reasons why i stopped
                        playing was because i started playing basketball with my friends more constistently. I think i
                        got more commited to basketball because you need less people to have a competative game than
                        soccer. </p>
